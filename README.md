# Gar & Sean's C Project!
## Project ideas
* text to ASCII art generator
    * take in text, output the text in a dope ass ASCII art font
    * be able to read in new, user-supplied fonts
* Pac-Man
    * classic Pac-Man game using some C graphics library
    * allow for user-supplied maps?
    * an added challenge: make the ghosts extra smart (like teaming up to wall
      off the player)
