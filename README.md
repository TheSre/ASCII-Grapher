# Gar & Sean's C Project!
## Project ideas
* **ASCII graphing utility (settled on this 'un)**
    * /|\-+<> etc can probably be used for shapes of curves/lines
    * can and should be limited to certain classes of functions
    * could try to make this very lightweight as a challenge, or alternatively very expansive in capabilities
* text to ASCII art generator
    * take in text, output the text in a dope ass ASCII art font
    * be able to read in new, user-supplied fonts
    * hybrid fonts!
* Pac-Man
    * classic Pac-Man game using some C graphics library
    * allow for user-supplied maps?
    * an added challenge: make the ghosts extra smart (like teaming up to wall
      off the player)
    * add extra neat features? 6D pacman?
* Virtual Rubik's Cube
    * rotating view as well as turning individual faces
    * challenge modes with blind solving/higher order cubes?
    * as a side note this and pac man can be thrown into a broader games category maybe
* recreate the entirety of the linux kernel (easy option, we should pick something more challenging)
